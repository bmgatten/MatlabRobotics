# MatlabRobotics
## UC Davis MAE 252 Class Project
### Project Scope
This code simulates a spraying robot in an orchard. It utilizes the Traveling Salesman Algorithm (TSP) to determine an optimal traversal route based on NDVI data obtained from previous measurements. Key parameters are the row width, the number of plants/row, and the vehicle turning radius.

### Using Protected Matlab Files 

```Matlab
function [q_true_next, odo] = robot_odo(q_true, u, umin, umax,Qmin, Qmax, L, tau_gamma, tau_v)
% model of a vehicle with closed loop steering and velocity control
% the combined effect of steering/vehicle inertia and control is
% a first order system for steering (tau_phi) and velocity (tau_v)
% state is
% q(1) -> x
% q(2) -> y
% q(3) -> theta (orientation in world frame)
% q(4) -> gamma (steering angle)
% q(5) -> linear velocity
 
% inputs are:
% u(1) -> desired steering angle
% u(2) -> desired linear velocity
%
% the model returns the next state q1 and noisy odometry, i.e.,
% distance traveled in DT in odo(1) and angle change in DT in odo(2).
% note:robot_odo relies on global integration constants dT and DT. 



function [ x_n, y_n, theta_n ] = GPS_CompassNoisy( x, y, theta )
% function accepts as arguments the true pose of the robot (from q_true) and returns a noisy measurement of the pose. Angle is in radians.
